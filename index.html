                                     The General Speakers List (GSL) is essentially the list of all delegates who wish to make a speech on the agenda
in general. The time given to an individual Delegate is usually 90 seconds to make his
speech and this duration can be extended by raising a motion as soon as roll call is done. Then the EB recognises speakers for the GSL with a show of respective placards. The GSL runs throughout the duration of the three days with
willing speakers adding their names to the list. If you wish to add your name to the GSL at a later point, you can do
so by sending a chit asking for your country/character to be added to the existing list.

                        <p class="white">Moving on from formal debate, we now deal with motions. A motion, as the name suggests, is used to move the proceedings of the committee into either informal debate from formal debate, or into a break. 
                            The EB asks for motions usually after 3 or 4 speeches are done or if they feel the need for a particular motion.
Informal debate is divided into two parts, the Unmoderated Caucus and the Moderated Caucus. Unmoderated caucuses are slightly more disruptive (cause disturbance) in nature.
Whereas, the moderated caucuses are a lot like the formal form of debate with sub agendas of the main
Agenda.</p>

                                <h3 class="alt-features-title font-alt">Moderated Caucus</h3>
                                <div class="alt-features-descr align-left white">
                                     <p>The moderated caucus is basically where you discuss the sub-agendas of the overall agenda in the committee.
For example, if the agenda is 'Pollution', then the sub agendas would be 'Air Pollution' or 'Water Pollution'.
</p>

<p>As mentioned in the earlier section, motion for a moderated caucus can be raised by
following a verbatim/format, which is, “The delegate of [country name] would like to raise a motion to suspend formal debate
and move into a moderated caucus on the topic [sub agenda] for a total time period [total time] with
individual speakers time being [individual speakers time] each”.</p>

<p>For example, “The delegate of Spain would like to raise a motion to suspend formal debate and move into a moderated caucus on the topic “Water pollution” for a time period of 20 minutes, with individual speaker's time of 60 seconds”. This motion, if passed, establishes a moderated caucus that accomodates 20 speakers for a discussion on water pollution. Make sure that the total
time period is exactly divisible by individual speakers time.</p>
<p>After various motions are raised by the delegates, the Executive Board sets them for a vote. This is a classic example of procedural voting, in which a 50% plus one of the members will have to agree (If the
committee has 8 members, then 5 members have to agree on it or if the committee has 15 members,
then 9 members have to agree on it.) Then the delegate who raised the moderated caucus will choose
either to be the first or the last speaker.</p>

                                <div class="alt-features-descr align-left white">
                                     <p>This is when the delegates are allowed to leave their seats and
approach anyone in the committee. This time is usually reserved for lobbying (A word coming from the
practise of Delegates to meet in the UN lobby to discuss various substantial issues, it means trying to
talk someone into supporting your view), to reach a compromise or a consesus on various issues, and to
plan the future course of action in the committee amongst themselves. The unmoderated caucus can be
raised when the EB invites motions, it is raised using the verbatim “The Delegate of {Country Name}
would like to suspend formal debate and move into an Unmoderated Caucus for a time period {Time
Period}”, for example “The Delegate of India would like to raise a motion to suspend formal debate and move into an
Unmoderated Caucus for a time period of 15 minutes." As the Unmoderated Caucus is the most
disruptive, whenever the motion is raised by a delegate, it is almost always the one to be first voted
upon.</p><p>
During this while, the Delegates can get up from their seats, walk around the room, leave the council
room, go and talk to anyone whether it be the Executive Board, any other delegate or any member of
the Organising Committee. This is somewhat similar to a break however it is strongly adviced that this
time should be used to plan the proceedings of the committee or to win over some other delegate to
support your cause. As almost every Executive Board marks on the lobbying skills of a Delegate.</p>

Procedural Voting is done for changing the time
limit for the GSL, passing of any motion, or for the temporary suspension of
committees for the breaks. First the Executive Board asks for those who are in support of the motion,
then those who oppose it. If there are any members who are in oppose the motion, the executive board
asks for the those who are ‘For’ the motion, and those who are ‘Against’ it. For this round there is a
requirement of 50% + 1 number of delegates to be for the motion for it to pass.
In procedural voting no one can abstain, and it is absolutely compulsory for all the members of the room
to vote.

After the three days of the committee are towards an end, after every country/group of countries have submitted their documentation. It is time for those documents to be put to vote. During the substantial voting only the member nations can vote, and often the observer nations are requested to leave the room. Usually the votes can be given in the following ways:</p>
<p>Yes: You are in favor of the document, and it is completely aligned to your foreign policy.</p>
<p>No: Your country does not wish for the document to be passed.</p>
<p>Yes with rights: You are in favor of the document, however you require time to explain to the committee why you are in favor of the document. This is usually done when the document endorses policies which are not aligned with the usual stance taken by the delegate in the committee or the foreign policy of the country. On discretion of the executive board, the delegate is given a certain time to make the his reasons clear.</p>
<p>No with rights: The delegate is not in favor of the document, however requires time to explain to the committee, why he is taking this particular stance. (Reread Yes with rights)</p>
<p>Abstain: The delegate is neither in favor of the document, nor against it. They wish to remain neutral in regard to the document. </p>

                                    This is a rather tricky yield, as it allows other delegates to make comments on the speech that the delegate just made. This can allow a few rival countries extra time to make points against the delegate’s interests. Unless the Delegate has made really substantial points which can change the committee direction it is not wise to yield to comments.

On the other hand, if you wish to make a speech which will require more than the allotted time, you can request the delegate whose name comes above you in the GSL to yield some time to you.

Any one delegate or a bloc can write a draft resolution. It is a document that contains all the issues that the committee wants to solve along with their proposed solutions. It is usually written during unmoderated caucuses as a working paper and then compiled into a resolution. The draft resolution is usually written in points, with a certain style and grammar (Google how to write a resolution for a MUN). If a majority is obtained, the draft resolution becomes a resolution that is passed in the committee.

A working paper is a set of arbitrary solutions proposed in the committee according to which a draft resolution is made. It should include how to make the solutions more effective and and how to make amends to failed implementations, if there were any. It must contain operative clauses and the bounds and mandate of the council should be kept in mind.

A press release is an official statement from the delegate of a country to the international press regarding the views of the nation regarding the agenda of the committee and their stand on it. These are simple releases and do not require voting unless the executive asks for it specifically.

It is a final paper which has solutions which are in agreement with the stance taken by all the delegates in the committee. It is difficult to pass a communique as it will fail even if a single member in the committee digresses. A communique usually passed is binding in nature. All the member nations of the council are bound by law to follow it.

Some committees in a conference require you to send a position paper beforehand. A position paper explains your country’s situation pertaining to the agenda of the committee. It is a document that contains your country’s policies and position in regards to the matter. A position paper is usually of one or two pages and contains your country’s official letterhead. It should be simple and should contains what your country has been doing and what it believes should be done to address the agenda. It should also contain how the agenda affects your country and your country’s history with the agenda.

The committee is resolved as soon as the issue is under control. The details of the committee, including the budget, the background, the parties involved, the obligations, mandate, hierarchy are mentioned in a document.

In crisis committees, such as the Arab League, the delegates, usually, have executive authority over the military forces pertaining to certain restrictions. Essentially, they can move their troops, plan strategic, covert spy missions, tactical movements, propaganda missions etc. These are done through action orders, the format of which, will be provided in the background guide or by the executive board.
